    <string name="fin">During the Clone Wars, many of the Galaxy\'s inhabitants were concerned about the outcome of the war and its effects on the galactic economy. Because of this, the overwhelming majority of planets outside of the Core and Inner Rim do not accept credits. These planets and regions began to mint their own coins. The Empire continued to use the credit, now called the Imperial credit, since it was their primary currency, and during the reign of Emperor Palpatine, very few did not accept it. Even the Alliance to Restore the Republic took it out, along with their own Alliance credit, as it was the easiest and most used currency in the Galaxy.</string>
